How the game works:

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" organized during a grid. The deck is formed from eight completely different pairs of cards, every with completely different symbols on one facet. The cards square measure organized willy-nilly on the grid with the image face down. The gameplay rules square measure terribly simple: flip 2 hidden cards at a time to find those that match!

Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying image.
The player then turns over a second card, attempting to search out the corresponding card with a similar image.
If the cards match, each cards keep flipped over.
If the cards don't match, each cards square measure flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards are properly matched.
